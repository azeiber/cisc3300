1. What is SQL? MySQL? What are relational databases? SQL is a standard language for database creation and manipulation.
MySQL is a relational database program that uses SQL queries. Relational databases use structure that allow us to identify
and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database (relationships).
2. What is normalization in SQL? Normalization arranges the columns and tables in a database to ensure data integrity 
and maintain proper relationships.
3. What are primary and foreign keys? Primary keys are fields that are used to uniquely identify records in a table. It
cannot be null, it needs to be unique, and only one can be defined per table. A foreign key is a field that references
the primary key in another table.
4. What are the three relationship types? One-to-one means that for every record in the primary table there is one and
only one record in the table. One-to-many means that for every record in the primary table, there are one or more related
records in the foreign table. Many-to-many means that for every record in the primary table, there are many related records in
the foreign table and for every record in the foreign table, there are many related records in the primary table.
5. What is the difference between a left join and an inner join? Left join returns all records from the left table and the
matching records from the right table. The inner join selects records that have matching values in both tables.
