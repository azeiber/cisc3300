1. What is the DOM? What is meant by the DOM tree? The DOM stands for Document
Object Model, which specifies how browswers create models of HTML pages, and also
how JavaScript can access the contents of a webpage and update it while it is
in the browswer window. As the browser loads, the model being created is what is called
the DOM tree. The DOM tree has four nodes: document nodes (the page), element nodes
(individual elements), attribute nodes (attributes), text nodes (text). 
2. What is an XSS attack? How do they work? How can you guard against them?
XSS attacks are when attackers are able to gain access to users' accounts. These
attackers are able to inject malicious code that is executed as HTML and potentially
could potentially be run for different users. One way to guard against this is to be
very careful with the content that is treated as html. There should rarely be an option
available to show input that came from a user at all.
3. What is an event in JavaScript? An event in JavaScript is an event that happens in the
browser, such as a user clicking a button or a form being submitted.
4. How does a DOM eventListener work? This works by attaching an event handler to an element
without overwriting existing event handlers.
What are the parameters it is expecting? 
document.getElementById('event-listener').addEventListener('click' -> preferred)
5. What is jQuery? Why use it? How do we load jQuery onto a page? jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript
and the purpose is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on a website. It is loaded onto a page via a
cdn, similar to bootstrap.
