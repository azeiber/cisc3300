Write a query string with 2 values for www.example.com
www.example.com?name=Alexa&age=21
2. What is meant by escaping a character? Escaping an HTML character stops the browser
HTML interpreter from treating it as HTML.
3. What are the following HTTP status and their meanings:
a. 200: OK (request was successful)
b. 400: Bad Request (server cannot understand the request)
c. 401: Unauthorized (missing or invalid credentials)
d. 403: Forbidden (server understands the request but will not authorize it)
e. 404: Not Found (resource was not found)
f. 500: Internal Server Error (server encountered an unexpected error)
4. Why do we need to validate data? Validating data is important because if the data
from the front end is not checked and verified, it can break things
5. What are sessions and cookies? What do they do? Cookies are text files that store
data about users for specific websites and browsers. Sessions are similar because
they are text files, but they store information about a user on the server, not 
the website or browser.
6. Create some kind of expectation in a try block, throw an exception with a custom
message in the catch block
<?php
try {
    // Expectation: expect a positive number for $num
    $num = -5;  // Example input that doesn't meet the expectation

    if ($num <= 0) {
        throw new Exception("Input must be a positive number.");
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Exception: ($num) is not greater than 0.";
}
?>
