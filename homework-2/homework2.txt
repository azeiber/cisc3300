3. Both Flexbox and CSS grid are helpful layout systems compatible with all modern browsers. Flexbox utilizes a 1d layout system, whereas CSS Grid utilizes a 2d layout system. Flexbox utilizes a parent element, which is the container, and then child elements, which are the items. CSS Grid also utilizes parent and child elements. The parent element (container) defines the columns and rows and the children determine their own location based on the grid dimensions set in the parent element.
