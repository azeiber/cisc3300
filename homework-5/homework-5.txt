1. What is HTTP? What are the different HTTP request methods and how do they differ? HTTP is a
protocol responsible for how the internet handles communication between clients and servers. This
is done by requests and responses. Requests are initiated by the recipient.
2. What is an API? What is JSON? APIs are ways for two or more computer programs or components
to communicate with each other. APIs can be accessed by using HTTP requests. JSON is JavaScript
object notation and is an open standard file format that contains easily readable text to store 
data objects. These data objects consist of attribute-value pairs and arrays.
3. What is AJAX? What is meant by asynchronous code? AJAX makes websites and web applications 
more responsive by exchaning data with a web server behind the scenes. Asynchronous means
code means that multiple two or more events can occur at the same time, so asynchronus code
means that it is possible to update parts of a webpage without reloading the entire page.
4. What is REST and what are resources? REST is an architectural style of organizing code so
that requests act in a standard way.
If my application had a concept called posts and
was designed in a RESTful way, what would the URI and HTTP request method be to:
a. retrieve multiple posts
URI: /posts HTTP: GET
b. retrieve a single post
URI: /posts{id} HTTP: GET
c. save a post
URI: /posts HTTP: GET
d. update a post
URI: /posts HTTP: PUR
5. Define hoisting and closures in JS. Hoisting is when variables and functions are created
before they are executed. This consists of a preparation phase which takes all variables and
function and "hoists" them to the top of the execution. Each execution creates its own variable
object. Closures are when a function is able to remember different variables and functions that
are declared in the outer scope. Closures can be down only by looking up, not down.
